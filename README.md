Breast Cancer Recurrence Prediction

Data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/14/breast+cancer

XGBoost: Emily

Support Vector Machine: Mack

Random forest: Michele


Introduction:
Our dataset is called Breast Cancer and it was donated to the UCI Machine Learning Repository on 7/10/1988. This data was obtained from the Oncology Institute in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia. With this dataset we aim to make a maachine learning model that can predict the recurrence of breast cancer from patient data. This dataset has patient data on age, menopause, tumor size, invaded nodes, node caps, degree of malignancy, breast, breast quadrent, and irradiation treatment. Three different models will be trained with this data and compared for their ability to predict recurrence events in these patients. The three selected models are XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVC), and Random Forest. The dataset showed there has been previous success using these models and hopefully we can replicate this through this project.
